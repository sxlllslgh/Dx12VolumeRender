# Dx12VolumeRender

An exploratory project to implement ray-casting based volume rendering in C++/WinRT with DirectX 12, mainly for learning the development of WindowsAppSDK (WinUI 3) and the whole development process of DirectX 12.

> Writing WinUI with C++/WinRT is a very painful thing, it is recommended that people who are not inclined to self-abuse should not try it.
